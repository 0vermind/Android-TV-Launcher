Android TV Launcher is intended to be an attractive, remote controllable Android Launcher (Home screen) to empower Android on the Television.

------------------------
What it's intended to do
------------------------

Think of Android TV Launcher as a way to get to all of your favorite apps from the comfort of your couch.  Using only directional buttons on a remote control, you can select an app and launch it directly from Android TV.  

Above all, Android TV Launcher is a hobby project to fuel my interests in HTPC (Home Theater PCs).

-------------------------
What it's not meant to do
-------------------------

Android TV Launcher isn't meant to be a TV app on your phone.  It's simply a launcher to get you to great apps like Hulu, Netflix, YouTube and more.

Inspiration
-----------

In it's current stage, Android TV Launcher is intended to function much like the Roku home screen.  The horizontal scrolling layout provides simple, elegant, remote friendly access to all of your apps without the needs for a gyro remote or touchscreen.
